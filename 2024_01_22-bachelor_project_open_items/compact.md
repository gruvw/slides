Start:

- Greetings, thank you all for coming today, Lucas Jung
- Explain all those words (in blue), time being

Plan:

- deep dive, line demonstrations, live demonstration, around the project

Problem Space: two observations

- examples: shopping, TODO lists, films to watch, project ideas, new year resolutions, trips planning, gifts ideas, ...
- 2 fundamental issues: not easy to use, calendar integrations + contacts, "looking to be the best too to fit all uses but end up being the right one for none"
- only android, only desktop, native note app on your phone
- not have an internet connection when you need your lists, privacy concerns with most sensitive data, questions you need to ask to your doctor, list of medicines you take, things you buy or want, invaluable data for data brokers or advertisers
- Free-Software, free not only as in price but also as in freedom
- Cost / freemium / ads or Subscriptions
- Transparency, tell you they don't collect, no way to check, need source code
- Intentionally hard to switch app
- Community: everyone can help, add functionalities, fix and report bugs
- Self hosting: server at home
- Big disadvantage on the developer, hard to get funding (donations, B2B)

Open-Items solution:

- empowering users with technology to allow quality of life features (search, transfer between accounts)
- Easy to use, simple yet powerful interface
- Full project specifications

Bachelor contribution:

- Full Open-Items project is way too big, application only "client" part
- Build a steady basis to group upon later, very technical
- Goal of today's presentation, give a higher level view of the whole project, give a glimpse of what I spent my time on this semester

Demonstration:

- WEB version, app easily available on major platforms (android, apple devices, windows and linux)
- Explain design phase (two colors, minimalist)
- Offline first, difference between online and offline accounts
- Form validation, infinite list nesting

Challenges encountered:

- Store and persist data and all platforms
- Model establishment
- Server side code to integrate nicely, not have to re-write everything
- Hard to validate user data, not to break things
- Intended to integrate more features during the semester, might have underestimated a bit the amount of work required, already took a lot of time, could not integrate more features than that during the semester, easier to add functionalities in the future

Statistics:

- Very rare to write tho correct code on the fist try
- There were a total of 14 people that tested the app, some of them are actually here in the room
- More technical document, details the architectural choices / code

Future of Open-Items:

- In my free time, future semester project at EPFL
- Think the application has a bright future ahead, hope it will be successful to people looking for this kind of solution

Conclusion:

- First working version, enjoyed coding the app
- Designed to be efficient
- Follows the Open-source philosophy and is available on most platforms and devices
- New features in the coming years
- Learn more on GitHub project repository

- Thanks to Dr. Jamila Sam and Dr. Barbara Jobstmann for making this project possible by supervising my work during the semester
- Thank you all for your time and attention
- Now I would be happy to answer any questions you might have about the project or the presentation
